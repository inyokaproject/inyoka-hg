How To Install
--------------

Inyoka just integrates a nearly full featured test-suite. It's based on the python-module
`unittest` and on the external library `nosetest`. To get the coverage support running we need
the `coverage` module. So everything we need to do is entering `easy_install nose coverage`.
And Baam, we got it!


How To Run
----------

Well, before we can run it we need to setup a test database. It doesn't matter how it's called.
The name defaults to `inyoka_test` but you can use the environment variable `INYOKA_TEST_DATABASE`
to choose your own. Just create this database now.

Everything you now need to do is: `make test`
…and everything runs… or now :-)


How To Write
------------

This chapter is a bit more complex. But actually, writing unittests is easy. You can read
http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/wiki/WritingTests to get a basic idea.

Our unittests are well structured and yet good documentated. Every Inyoka-Application (forum, planet etc.)
have it's own testing folder/module. There are all tests for each submodule located. So just use the
already existing infrastructure and extend it.

So let's say we wanna create a new unittest for the module `inyoka.portal.forms`. That way we
just create a new file called `tests/portal/test_portal_forms` or make it a seperate module (folder)
if all tests grow too big. In that new test file we can now add our unittests. For example::

		from tests import view

		@view('/', component='portal')
		def test_basic_index(client, tctx, ctx):
		    assert tctx['pm_count'] == 0

For more examples see existing tests or `tests/__init__.py` which is quite good documented.
